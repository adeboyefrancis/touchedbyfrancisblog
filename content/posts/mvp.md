This week blog post, I dove deep into the world of infrastructure automation for launching a **Minimum Viable Product Application**, specifically focusing on **building custom AMIs with Packer**. 
I successfully automated the release of new versions by applying **semantic versioning**  and also automated the configuration of my AMIs with pre-installed softwares such as **Nginx, Gunicorn, PostgreSQL and  Python Virtual Environment for Django Framework  using Bash scripting**, streamlining my infrastructure setup process. 

### Building Custom AMIs with Hashicorp Packer
Leveraging **HashiCorp Packer**, I created custom AMIs using **"Image as Code"** principles, enabling consistent **multi-platform virtual machine images**. 
Initially, I faced **IAM permission** challenges during build processes. By carefully analyzing error messages, I identified and added critical missing IAM actions: **"autoscaling:DescribeLaunchConfigurations", "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplates", and "ec2:DeleteLaunchTemplate"**. 
These additions resolved build failures and successfully enabled AMI creation.

### Launching EC2 Instances with Custom AMIs
Once the AMI was ready, the next step was to launch EC2 instances using it. I implemented a **Github Action workflow dispatch** mechanism to select the desired **AMI release version** . This approach provides flexibility for launching instances from different AMI versions and **rolling back to stable versions** if needed.
I faced a few challenges during the launch process. Initially, filtering AMIs by name didn't work as expected. I resolved this by appending a wildcard to the filter. Additionally, I encountered issues with passing variables to the Terraform script. I eventually found a workaround by using environment variables.

###  Connecting to EC2 Instances with SSM
To streamline instance access, I configured **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** by creating **instance profile** and attaching it to the running instance with the required **role, permission,SSM core policy** and integrating it directly into my Terraform script. 
This approach enabled seamless, **secure connectivity** to EC2 instances without traditional SSH methods, enhancing both **operational efficiency and security**.

### Configuring AMIs with Bash Scripting for Automated Set-up
The final step in my infrastructure automation involved creating a **Bash script** to pre-install critical web application components. My goal was to streamline the AMI configuration by integrating **Django Framework, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Gunicorn and a Python virtual environment** into a cohesive deployment ecosystem.
My start-up web application stack integrates multiple technologies seamlessly: **Django** serves as the web framework, powered by **Gunicorn** as the **WSGI HTTP** server for efficient Python web application deployment. **Nginx** acts as a robust reverse proxy, handling client requests and directing traffic to **Gunicorn**, while **PostgreSQL** provides a powerful, **relational database backend**. The entire ecosystem is encapsulated within a **Python virtual environment**, ensuring clean **dependency management and isolation**.
During the setup, I encountered a significant challenge with database configuration. Specifically, I faced an issue with generated **Open SSL** password escaping some characters with the **sed** command in my script that prevented correct loading of database credentials from the environment variable. Through careful debugging, I identified and resolved the problem by implementing proper escaping techniques with pipes and backslash, ensuring secure and reliable database connectivity.
